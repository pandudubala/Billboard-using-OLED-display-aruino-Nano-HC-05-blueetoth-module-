# Billboard-using-OLED-display-aruino-Nano-HC-05-blueetoth-module-
arduino Nano -based Bluetooth billboard using an arduino nano microcontroller, 0.96" OLED Display (SPI/I2C, 128x64), and an HC-05 Bluetooth module. The code allows the billboard to receive messages via Bluetooth and display them on the OLED screen.
How to Pair and Send Messages via Bluetooth (HC-05)
Step 1: Pairing HC-05 with Your Device
Power On the STM32 board with the HC-05 connected.
On your phone or PC, go to Bluetooth settings.
Look for a device named "HC-05" in the list of available devices.
Tap on it to pair. If it asks for a PIN, enter "1234" or "0000".
Once paired, the HC-05's LED should blink slower (indicating a successful connection).
Step 2: Sending Messages to the Billboard
You'll need a Bluetooth terminal app to send text messages to the STM32.
For Android:
Install "Serial Bluetooth Terminal" from the Play Store.
Open the app and tap on the "Devices" tab.
Select HC-05 and connect.
Go to the "Terminal" tab.
Type a message and press Send. It will appear on the OLED screen!
Troubleshooting Tips
If the message doesnâ€™t show on the OLED, check the wiring of the HC-05 (TX-RX).
Make sure the OLED I2C address is correct (0x3C).
Ensure the HC-05 is paired and connected before sending messages.\
